      <h2>Take a Break</h2>
      <p>When the timer hits 00:00, it's your cue to take a well-deserved break! Recharge your energy before diving into your next task.</p>
      <p>This approach is inspired by the famous <span className='font-bold'>Pomodoro Technique</span>! It's all about repeating simple cycles, like 30 minutes: 25 minutes of forcused work followed by a 5-minute break.</p>
      <p>But, we've got more options for you. Check out these flexible schedules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>15 minutes</span> â†’ 10 minutes work + 5 minutes break</li>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>30 minutes</span> â†’ 25 minutes work + 5 minutes break</li>
        <li><span className='font-bold'>2 hours</span> â†’ 45 minutes work + 10 minutes break + 45 minutes + 30 minutes break</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pick a schedule and set the timerâ€”no overthinking needed!ðŸ”¥</p>
      <p>Nobody can stay fully focused for long periods without praticeâ€”it takes time to build that skill.</p>
      <p>Just do your best to focus for as long as you can, and with consistency, you'll eventually discover the perfect rhythm that works for you.</p>
